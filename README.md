## Lifeboat Linux

Live linux distro combined in one ~35MB file. Runs as a EFI binary so it should run on any UEFI computer (PC or Mac) without installation. Just copy one file to EFI system partition and boot.

## Motivation

Sometimes I mess my setup and need to use a live USB to be able to access my filesistem and edit some config file to bring it back to life.
I was inspired by [OneFileLinux](https://github.com/zhovner/OneFileLinux) to create a minimal rescue system based on that idea. Also the fork from [D4rk4](https://github.com/D4rk4/OneRecovery) was helpful in getting the build to work.


## What to expect

This distro can be used to access your filesystem and perform basic tasks as edit config files. It can be also handy to resize partitions.

Networking is untested.
