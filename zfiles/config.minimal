## VIDEO SECTION
#
# Just trying to figure out the minimal things needed to make video work
# on all possible hosts. I'm limited to testing on a virtual machine, my
# desktop and my laptop, so it may not work for you.
#
# For each case between parenthesis I'm keeping the output from `dmesg | grep fb`
# to understand what each system is making use of.

# These alone enables video on my laptop with intel graphics (i915drmfb),
# but is not enough for VM or my desktop with nvidia card.

# This makes the VM and desktop select (simple-frambuffer) over (efifb).

# I did not need them on the VM nor my desktop, but will not cause harm if

# seeing how much space it takes enabling these vs not doing it.
